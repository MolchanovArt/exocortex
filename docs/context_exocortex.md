# Exocortex Context

Exocortex is a personal 'second brain' and orchestrator of AI agents.
The long-term idea:

- Capture raw inputs (notes, chats, documents, events) into a unified graph.
- Maintain a persistent, evolving memory about the user.
- Decompose user goals into tasks.
- Orchestrate agents/tools to execute tasks.

This repo starts from:
- FreeMinder: pipeline `raw input -> structured memory -> tasks/ideas`.
- Minimal integrations: Telegram, Google Calendar, Google Drive.
- Local-only prototype, using OpenAI as the reasoning engine.
